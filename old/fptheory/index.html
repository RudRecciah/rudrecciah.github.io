      So, first of all, if you couldn't tell from that intro, the trailer for Finding Paradise's switch version released the literal second I made this video public. I already know that it's mostly satire, but that's the thing. It's MOSTLY satire. The thing is, at the end of the trailer, there's three small details that can prove a theory... that Colin isn't who we think he is.
<br>
<br>
So, lets start off with some of the things we knew before this trailer was made. Faye has godly powers in the machine during the entirety of Finding Paradise. The machine runs on a closed-source Linux distro or a closed-source OS based on Unix. The patient's brain is used to simulate memories, not just read and write them. Faye is nothing more than Colin's imaginary friend; she's just a shell that needs someone or something to be her brain. Things like reading and writing memories is only possible for the machine's root/system account. When a user executes a command, the machine will choose to run that command or not depending on the amount of brain activity of the user who executed the command.
<br>
<br>
While all of these small technicalities might seem useless, they actually give us guidelines to base theories off of. This theory specifically, that Colin isn't who we think he is, can be proven using these rules. How? Faye can interact with the doctors, meaning that she can act at will. This is impossible as she is just a shell which needs someone or something else to control her. She can't be controlled by the simulation running the memories since each simulated object can be completly controlled by the doctors. She can't be controlled by the machine used during the procedure because Neils potential plans with her and the machine would become redundant. There are only two ways she could interact with the doctors at will: She's either the same Faye controlling the simulation that contains the entire series so far, or she's actually Colin hiding inside Faye's disguise. Yes, while that really doesn't get us far with figuring out who she is, it gets us far enough for what we need. We know that she knew how to use the machine. She just knew instantly, even able to interact with the doctors in Colin's latest accessable memory, just minutes after she would've seen the machine for the first time. Whether she's Colin or Faye, she knows how to use the machine. The problem is, she shouldn't be able to know.
<br>
<br>
Colin, and by extension Faye, has no way to learn how to use the machine. He can't look it up, because the machine is closed-source. He couldn't have had experience using it, because the only thing he needed removed from his memories to be happy was Sigmund, not the machine itself. He couldn't have found out from someone in the industry, because the only person comftorable explaining the machine and procedure to the general public is Neil, who would've known if he told Colin which would have changed the procedure drastically. We also know that Colin didn't know how to use the machine from birth, because then the ad for Sigmund wouldn't have been the thing to send him back into the time of choosing his fate. The machine's gesture controls are also not intuitive or easy to learn, because Neil himself can't even use them easily. So, if Colin couldn't have found out how to use the machine before and during the procedure, and he never knew from birth, how did he control the machine? The answer is simple. He's not the real Colin.
<br>
<br>
Neil and Eva's reality, at least in Finding Paradise and To The Moon, is simulated. Who controls that simulation? You might say its Eva because she was using the machine in Minisode 2. You might say its Neil, because he's trying to develop his own machine because Sigmund's machines are "wasted potential". But, what if it's someone else, like Colin? Just like how the doctors have control over the simulated objects inside memories, Faye (as in the version of Faye that was on the motorcycle Neil liked and who gave Potato her teddy bear back if Neil was chosen to deal with the situation between Potato and Amber) can control the simulated objects, as shown when she removes herself from Neil's memory. I doubt that, during TTM and FP, we're in Neil's memories. I doubt that Faye was trying to change Neil's memories for the better. In Neil's eyes, the machine has wasted potential. If the machine had wasted potential, he wouldn't be using it at the end of his life for the same reason he used it at the end of his patient's lives. The simulation he's in is a different computer with a different purpose, it's not just his machine.
<br>
<br>
Now, lets take a look at the ending of Finding Paradise's switch trailer. There are five small, but very important details. First of all, while Colin's talking to someone in what we think is the Sigmund Guest House, there's some differences between his version and Johnny's. Colin's talking to a different person, and there's no machine in the room. When we leave the daydream, the person Colin's talking to seems to address him differently than a normal customer. He sounds more formal, like Colin isn't just trying to sign a contract. In the daydream, we see Neil and Roxie fight. While this is satire, the ending of the trailer is not. Colin shouldn't know who Neil and Roxie are, unless, of course, they are his creation. Finally, at the end of the trailer, when we see the title screen, we see two things that shouldn't be able to exist in the same place. Colin's book and Faye. Colin remembered Faye as his book. Faye and the book can't exist together. They're the same thing in his mind. That means that the Faye we see is not the Faye that he knew, or at least not the Faye that fake Colin knew. She's another Faye entirely.
<br>
<br>
This is where everything comes together. Colin somehow knows how the machine works, Faye (and by extension again Colin) has control in the simulation running Neil and Eva's realities, that simulation isn't just Neil's memories being played back, and Colin is in on something at the end of the Finding Paradise switch trailer. How are all of these connected? It's simple. Colin is an engineer who wants to create an ancestor simulation. Why? There could be many reasons, but one of the most probable is that Colin had an imaginary friend called Faye who he based off of a bird he found when he was young and wants her to become a reality. A simulation can make her real. He would be able to actually see, hear, smell, and feel her. It wouldn't just be his imagination anymore. Neil, Eva, Sigmund itself? All his creation. The Colin the doctors work on during the procedure? A fun test to see what could've happened if he tried to keep Faye being able to follow her as a pilot instead of being able to make her a reality. The whole TTM series? Colin.
<br>
<br>
Colin isn't some random pilot with a wack wish and procedure. He's an engineer looking to turn his dreams into reality.
